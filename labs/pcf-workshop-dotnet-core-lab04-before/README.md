# Lab 4: Configuration

## STEP 1 - Default configuration

1. Navigate to the lab04-after project folder.
2. Add two appsettings.json files, one called appsettings.staging.json, and another appsettings.production.json.
3. Add any custom setting in each file that identifies the environment with that file, i.e., "Message": "Hello Staging".
